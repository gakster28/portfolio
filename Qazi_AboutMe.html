                 <p>Hello, my name is Soleiman Qazi. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer. Currently, I am trying to start up my own game development company. 
                 I have a few friends helping me along the way. We are working on a game called Salvation. It's a story about a boy named Vincent who's older brother Dante is killed for being a whistleblower in a medieval fictional society 
                 and how his Vincent gets his revenge. By creating games like this and posting them under the company name, I feel like my name will get out there and I can become a sucessful Software Engineer. I want these games to help me get
                 into the college of my choice and make it in the world. Pursuing this
                 career choice has been a dream of mine since a very young age.</p>
                 
                 <p>I feel like I'm a natural leader, because for all of the projects I have come up with, 
                 I crafted the team and assigned them their roles for the project. Within the group of people I work with,
                 it is always me dreaming and coming up with new ideas. I've gathered the skills I currently have over many years.
                 Currently, I'm taking a CSE class at school which teaches you many different coding languages.</p>
                 
                 <p>Throughout the years, I have also been taking game development classes in the local area.
                 For example, in the library, I have taken a few Clickteam Fusion classes and am comfortable using that program.
                 In my free time, I also develop games with my friends and the people I work with!</p>
