                    <h4>The Adventures of Bob the Cat was a game created using Scratch.
                    This was the first project in the PLTW Computer Science/Software Engineering class that I am taking.
                    At first, I couldn't find a way to time the character's interactions, but then I discovered I could use Scratch's broadcasting system.
                    It essentially released a code-word after a message was sent, so the other character knows when to speak.</h4>

                    <h4>This was my second big website. I created this website in 6th grade for a Greek project.
                    I decided to create an informational website about the Greek Gods and Greek Mythology in general.
                    The hard part about was mainly deciding the layout of the website. With some advice from my father,
                    I figured out how to make the website look best. I presented this website to the class and got hands
                    on experience with HTML and presenting.<a href="http://www.globalspot.com/greece/index.html"> Here is a link to my website!</a></h4>

                    <h4>This was my second project in the Computer Science/Software Engineering class that I am taking this year. It's a drawing application where you can color and draw on different backgrounds. At first, my partner and I had trouble getting the drawing to save, but then we found out we could use a tiny database to save the image. I gathered a lot of MIT App Inventor experience from this project.</h4>
